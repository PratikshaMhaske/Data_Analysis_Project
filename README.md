## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Data Analysis Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**.  
The objective of the project is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a restaurant dataset to extract meaningful insights related to cuisines, cities, pricing, services, ratings, votes, and geographic distribution.

The analysis is divided into **three levels**, each focusing on progressively advanced data analysis tasks.

### 🔹 Level 3: Advanced Analysis
- Analyzed restaurants with the **highest and lowest votes**
- Studied the **correlation between votes and aggregate ratings**
- Examined the relationship between **price range**, **online delivery**, and **table booking**
- Performed **rating-based analysis** in the absence of textual reviews
